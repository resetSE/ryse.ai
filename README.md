A multi-feature Discord bot written in discord.py, designed to stop me from adding 4 bots for moderation, music, fun, etc.


## This is a personal project. Feel free to use it, but it isn't ready for mass use (yet).

### Written in a really, and I mean really inefficient way. Currently rewriting from the ground up in the rewrite branch, using cogs. Feedback is welcome.
